# Obstacle-Course-game
Unity 3D

I started learning Unty 3D. I started with basics like using Rigidbody and Collision.

I used scripts to detect collion and take away points from the player and change the colour of objects being hit. I learned to get access to componenets and modify them through scripts.

I learend to use prefabs and basics to materials.
